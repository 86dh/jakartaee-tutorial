<h3 id="_what_is_messaging">What Is Messaging?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Messaging is a method of communication between software components or
applications. A messaging system is a peer-to-peer facility: A messaging
client can send messages to, and receive messages from, any other
client. Each client connects to a messaging agent that provides
facilities for creating, sending, receiving, and reading messages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Messaging enables distributed communication that is loosely coupled. A
component sends a message to a destination, and the recipient can
retrieve the message from the destination. What makes the communication
loosely coupled is that the destination is all that the sender and
receiver have in common. The sender and the receiver do not have to be
available at the same time in order to communicate. In fact, the sender
does not need to know anything about the receiver; nor does the receiver
need to know anything about the sender. The sender and the receiver need
to know only which message format and which destination to use. In this
respect, messaging differs from tightly coupled technologies, such as
Remote Method Invocation (RMI), which require an application to know a
remote application&#8217;s methods.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Messaging also differs from electronic mail (email), which is a method
of communication between people or between software applications and
people. Messaging is used for communication between software
applications or software components.</p>

<h3 id="_what_is_jakarta_messaging">What Is Jakarta Messaging?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jakarta Messaging is a Java API that allows applications to
create, send, receive, and read messages. Jakarta Messaging defines a common
set of interfaces and associated semantics that allow programs written
in the Java programming language to communicate with other messaging
implementations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jakarta Messaging minimizes the set of concepts a programmer must learn in
order to use messaging products but provides enough features to support
sophisticated messaging applications. It also strives to maximize the
portability of Messaging applications across providers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jakarta Messaging enables communication that is not only loosely coupled but also</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Asynchronous: A receiving client does not have to receive messages at
the same time the sending client sends them. The sending client can send
them and go on to other tasks; the receiving client can receive them
much later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reliable: A messaging provider that implements Jakarta Messaging can ensure
that a message is delivered once and only once. Lower levels of
reliability are available for applications that can afford to miss
messages or to receive duplicate messages.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The current version of the Jakarta Messaging specification is Version 2.0.</p>

<h3 id="_when_can_you_use_jakarta_messaging">When Can You Use Jakarta Messaging?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An enterprise application provider is likely to choose a messaging API
over a tightly coupled API, such as a remote procedure call (RPC), under
the following circumstances.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The provider wants the components not to depend on information about
other components' interfaces, so components can be easily replaced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provider wants the application to run whether or not all
components are up and running simultaneously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The application business model allows a component to send information
to another and to continue to operate without receiving an immediate
response.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, components of an enterprise application for an automobile
manufacturer can use Jakarta Messaging in situations like the following.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The inventory component can send a message to the factory component
when the inventory level for a product goes below a certain level so the
factory can make more cars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The factory component can send a message to the parts components so
the factory can assemble the parts it needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The parts components in turn can send messages to their own inventory
and order components to update their inventories and to order new parts
from suppliers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both the factory and the parts components can send messages to the
accounting component to update budget numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The business can publish updated catalog items to its sales force.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using messaging for these tasks allows the various components to
interact with one another efficiently, without tying up network or other
resources. <a href="#BNCDV">Figure 48-1</a> illustrates how this simple example
might work.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Manufacturing is only one example of how an enterprise can use the Jakarta Messaging
API. Retail applications, financial services applications, health
services applications, and many others can make use of messaging.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_how_does_jakarta_messaging_work_with_the_jakarta_ee_platform">How Does Jakarta Messaging Work with the Jakarta EE Platform?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When JMS was first introduced, its most important purpose was to
allow Java applications to access existing messaging-oriented middleware
(MOM) systems. Since that time, many vendors have adopted and
implemented JMS, so a Jakarta Messaging product can now provide a complete
messaging capability for an enterprise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jakarta Messaging is an integral part of the Jakarta EE platform, and application
developers can use messaging with Jakarta EE components. Jakarta Messaging 2.0 is part of
the Jakarta EE 8 release.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jakarta Messaging in the Jakarta EE platform has the following features.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Application clients, Jakarta Enterprise Beans components, and web
components can send or synchronously receive a Jakarta Messaging message. Application
clients can in addition set a message listener that allows Jakarta Messaging messages
to be delivered to it asynchronously by being notified when a message is
available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Message-driven beans, which are a kind of enterprise bean, enable the
asynchronous consumption of messages in the enterprise bean container. An
application server typically pools message-driven beans to implement
concurrent processing of messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Message send and receive operations can participate in Jakarta transactions,
which allow Jakarta Messaging operations and database accesses to take place within a single transaction.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jakarta Messaging enhances the other parts of the Jakarta EE platform by
simplifying enterprise development, allowing loosely coupled, reliable,
asynchronous interactions among Jakarta EE components and legacy systems
capable of messaging. A developer can easily add new behavior to a Jakarta
EE application that has existing business events by adding a new
message-driven bean to operate on specific business events. The Jakarta EE
platform, moreover, enhances Jakarta Messaging by providing support for Jakarta Transactions
and allowing for the concurrent consumption of messages.
For more information, see the Jakarta Enterprise Beans specification, v3.2.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Jakarta Messaging provider can be integrated with the application server using the
Jakarta EE Connector architecture. You access the Messaging provider through a
resource adapter. This capability allows vendors to create Messaging providers
that can be plugged in to multiple application servers, and it allows
application servers to support multiple Messaging providers. For more
information, see the Jakarta EE Connector architecture specification, v1.7.</p>
